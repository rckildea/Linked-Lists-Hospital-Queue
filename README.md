# Linked-Lists-Hospital-Queue
Simulates hospital software that keeps track of patients. Patients are held in a queue with varying priorities using a singly-linked list and node structure.  Three departments manage three separate queues of patients.  Patients can be added, added with critical care needed, removed, cancelled, or listed.
